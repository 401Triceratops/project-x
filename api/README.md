# True Proof API

This will be an API served by AWS Lambda that accepts proof measurements in requests and responds
with true proof calculations. Currently this is just "hello world" boilerplate.

# Building

Run
```
./gradlew :api:buildZip
```
The compiled file is found in `/api/build/distributions/api.zip`.

# API documentation
