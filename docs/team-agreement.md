## Team members

Seamus Brown
Barret Nance
Cristian Robles

## Communication plan

Our main channel of communication is our team discord's channel. When people are not on Discord, Slack is our second option to try and reach out to people. Remo can be used to meet with TAs and get help.

Daily standup with TAs: we'll touch base for 15 minutes to 30 minutes each day to talk about our progress on tasks or features and what needs to be done.

## Working hours

Our working hours are 9am - 5pm Pacific time. Anyone can work outside of the expected working hours. There is no expectation that people be available or working outside of working hours. However it's highly probable that people will be working or reachable outside working outside of working hours on any given day.

## Conflict plan

- When there's disagreements, put it to a majority vote. If a minority of members strongly disagrees with the majority or if we are at a stand still we bring each case to the instructor to resolve the issue.
- Try not to interrupt when we disagree so that we actually have a genuine opportunity to understand where the other person is coming from.
- If there is a conflict between specific members, the person(s) not involved should mediate as an objective party. The people not involved should also provide input because ultimately we are all figuring this out together.
- If we are in a conflict and it is becoming too stressful, anyone has the option to say “hey I need a break” and table the subject. We also can together agree on a break together and revisit the matter at a later time.
- Hard vetoing: Everyone has the ability to resolve a conflict by articulating whatever idea they feel very strongly about and why. The group will commit to incorporating that idea with a reasonable compromise.
- We hope and expect not to use these processes and resolve our conflicts as casually as possible. We collectively commit to falling back on these processes if we need to.

## Team communication guidelines

- When we are discussing on the project, iterating through everyone to hear their ideas
- We are all committed to giving everyone their fair chance to talk.
- Don’t hesitate to say something and bring it up to the group, or leave things unsaid.
- If someone feels like another member of the group could contribute more or may not be included, they are to directly ask that person for input.

## Git Process

- Main branch gets deployed
- Work is completed on semantically named feature branches
- Feature branches get PRed into dev
- One other person required to review a PR into dev
- Two reviews required to merge into main. (Discuss with team before merging into probably)
- How often will you merge feature branches into dev? Whenever necessary
- Notify team members on discord when you need your PR reviewed.
- Use code reviews or comments on PRs to make comments about code.
